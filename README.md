## React - Practical-09 Create a useFetch custom hook

# I developed this custom hook as part of a React practical exercise in the LMS. Below is the task description.

create a custom hook "useFetch" which takes URL, method (get/post/put/patch/delete), optional payload and an optional boolean flag for skipping the query call if consumer wants to skip the query based on certain conditions.

This custom hook should return the following things in form of object:

    isLoading
    response (actual data)
    error (if any)

Here's the free API that can be used: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Create a React app to demonstrate the usage of this hook.
